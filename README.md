# The RVA Aggregator

The RVA Aggregator is a sort of HTML parser and editor. Think of DNA when as it gets rewritten. Ideally, the RVAA will parse a basic structure, and rewrite it into another form. React to Vue, Vue to Angular, Angular to React. We know what we want to achieve, but not how.

Hence why it's a Blackfall project.
